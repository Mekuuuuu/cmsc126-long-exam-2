## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To run SimpliFi locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the project to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mekuuuuu/cmsc126-long-exam-2.git
cd cmsc126-long-exam-2
```


### 2. Set Python Version

Make sure you have [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed. Set the local Python version to `3.10.13`:

```bash
pyenv local 3.10.13/n
```

If you don‚Äôt have that version installed, run:
```bash
pyenv install 3.10.13
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:
```bash
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

Then create a virtual environment in the project folder:
```bash
python -m virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You can verify it's active by checking the Python path:
```bash
which python
```
If the output ends with venv/bin/python, you're good.

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are adding new modules, don't forget to update the file:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 5. Go to budget_tracker
Access manage.py for migration and runserver
```bash
cd budget_tracker
```

### 6. Apply Migration
Set up the database:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Run the Server
Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to use SimpliFi.

To deactivate your virtual environment anytime:
```bash

```
